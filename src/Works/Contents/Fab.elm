I have been interested in Digital Fabrication ever since I visited Fab Lab Kamakura in high school.

The ability to bring computational structures into the material world while maintaining the freedom provided in digital worlds is amazing and exciting.

On a more currently practical note, being able to make customized items for daily use is very nice :)
